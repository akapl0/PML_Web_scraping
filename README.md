# Web scraping
Materials for MIT Political Methodology Lab workshop on learning to scrape with Python. 
Taken and adapted (currently almost identical) from Andy Halterman's workshop materials on web scraping: [https://github.com/ahalterman/learn_to_scrape](https://github.com/ahalterman/learn_to_scrape). The workshop is split into two parts. First, we will get familiar with Python. Then we use it to learn how to scrape websites using `BeautifulSoup`.

## Before coming to the workshop
Please follow the [Setup instructions](https://github.com/akapl0/PML_Web_scraping/wiki/Setup-Instructions) on the Wiki before coming to the workshop so we can maximize the amount of time spent learning Python and web scraping.

## Contents
The presentation source and PDF files are in the `PML Presentation` folder. The practice exercises we go through during the workshop are in the `Python Notebooks` folder. The incomplete ones have a `_Skeleton` appendix and will be filled out during the workshop. For reference, there is a complete version of these notebooks in the `Completed` subfolder. For best results I suggest not looking at the solutions ahead of time.

- `Intro_to_Python_for_R_Users_Skeleton.ipynb` contains a skeleton of basic Python programming exercises worked through during the workshop.
- `Intro_to_Python_for_R_Users_Completed.ipynb` contains the "solutions" for `Intro_to_Python_for_R_Users_Skeleton`.
- `Scraper_Skeleton.ipynb` contains a skeleton of a web scraper and is what we'll be working through during the workshop.
- `Scraper_Completed.ipynb` contains the "solutions" for `Scraper_Skeleton`.
