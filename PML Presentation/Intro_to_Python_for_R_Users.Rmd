## Python vs. R

Python and R are fairly similar. This is a quick overview of the differences to help you get up to speed.

## Importing packages

- Importing packages is similar: instead of `[R] library(mypackage)`, do `[Python] import mypackage`.
- Python also lets you import specific functions from a package: `from mypackage import cool_function`
- You can also rename packages if they're too long: `import numpy as np`
- Installing packages is slightly different however: `[R] install.packages('mypackage')` as opposed to `[Python] pip install mypackage` OUTSIDE of Python either in the command line or Jupyter Notebooks.

## What are all those dots for? 

(Or, methods, attributes, and namespaces)

\pause

- Dots have special meaning in Python. It's not like R, where people put dots in all sorts of names.
- Python is much more careful about keeping packages' functions attached to the functions. If the `requests` library has a function called `get`, you call it like this `requests.get()`. This reminds you where the `get` function came from and prevents you from overwriting some other package's `get` function.
- Python is also more "object oriented" than R. Objects often have built in or attached functions, called methods. 


##  What are all those dots for? 

- Methods are called with a dot notation.

```
[R] strsplit("Andy Halterman", " ")
```
and

```
    [Python] "Andy Halterman".split(" ")
```

- Objects can also have attributes, which are pieces of data attached to an object. Example: `andy.subfields = ['methods', 'comparative']`

## Data Structures (Lists)

Like R's vectors, Python uses a lot of lists. These are ordered arrays. Note that Python starts with 0! 

```
my_list = [x, y, z]
> my_list[0] 
x
```

## Data Structures (Dictionaries)


Python has a data structure called a dictionary, which are like lists that you access by key name instead of by position (think a more general form of R's dataframes). Example:

```
article = {"title": "Rivalry and Revenge",
           "author" : "Balcells",
           "year" : "2017"}
```

\pause

```
> article.keys()
['title', 'author', 'year']
```

\pause

```
> article['author']
"Balcells"
```

## Loops and functions


Functions are only slightly different than in R:

```
def my_function(x):
    z = (x + 2)^2
    return z
```

\pause

Loops are fast and nice in Python, unlike in R, and are very easily done:

```
for i in my_list:
    my_function(i)
```

\pause

Pro move: list comprehensions:

```
[my_function(i) for i in my_list]
```


## Whitespace

- As you can tell, Python makes heavy use of whitespace to set apart different levels of functions, for loops, etc. Use four spaces (Jupyter converts tabs to four spaces automatically. 
- No need for curly braces!

```
def my_function(big_list):
    print(len(big_list))
    for l in big_list:
        for i in l:
            ...
    return stuff
```
